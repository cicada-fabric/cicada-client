# Handoff: CICADA Client ↔ fixed Hub `client-hub-v1.3`

**Date:** 2026-09-27

**Branch:** `dev/react-native`

**Implementation tested:** `9568b2ff6d4e156b70484c10b7fd5195405004b0`

## Current bounded acceptance — clean Hub `25013b5`

**Status: PASS for the bounded emulator/native scenario.** Ten fresh Android selectors passed, including final encrypted delivery status. The sole Core runner exited `0`; the original Monitor completed one preview and one dispatch, and both original recipient Threads passed exact-body and context assertions. This is not physical-device, public HTTPS or unattended cold-wake acceptance.

See the [fixed-image validation record](client-monitor-v13-25013b5-native-validation.md) for commands, exits and per-stage evidence. Its imported contract snapshot is `contracts/client-hub-v1.3-25013b5/`. The public wire, catalog and vectors are byte-identical to the previous snapshot; only the bundled development document changed. No product code or security check was relaxed for this run.

Evidence root:

```text
/gpu1-share/data/cicada-client/monitor-v13-25013b5-review-20260927T115633Z/evidence/
```

All ten Android selectors run through `python3 scripts/interop/monitor-android.py "$E" test ai.cicada.client.hub.MonitorHubInteropTest#<method> --label <label>` and returned ADB/driver `0/0`, `OK (1 test)`. The record lists every method and command JSON. The two marked Nodes, Monitor permission, three verified Group proofs, exact body including whitespace, and ordered two-recipient roster were reviewed in instrumentation-driven Android dialogs. This does not constitute a fresh complete React Native UI acceptance.

| Check | Result | Command exit / redacted evidence under the evidence root |
|---|---|---|
| Imported archive, clean running image and encrypted capabilities | **PASS** | Checker `0`; enrollment `0/0`; `bundle-image-import.json`, `contract-check.json`, `running-hub-provenance.redacted.json`, `native-enroll-capabilities.json` |
| Three original native Endpoint identities and full Kotlin verification | **PASS** | Manifest selector `0/0`; scope comparison `0`; `native-ready.redacted.json`, `native-manifests.json`, `native-scope-comparison.redacted.json` |
| External Owner signatures, explicit phone grants, three `CURRENT` statuses | **PASS** | Signer `0`; grant selector `0/0`; `owner-sign-groups.json`, `group-key-review.redacted.json`, `native-group-key-grants.json` |
| Explicit permission and one exact Prepare/Confirm | **PASS** | Three selectors `0/0`; handoff staging `0`; `permission-review.redacted.json`, `broadcast-review.redacted.json`, `native-prepare.json`, `native-confirm.json`, `native-stage-confirmed.json` |
| Native preview, single broadcast and both original recipients consuming the exact body in their retained contexts | **PASS** | Core `TestMCPMonitorBroadcastAndroidClientNative`: container `0`; `core-native-outcome.redacted.json`; actual Docker argv in Core `native-run.json` |
| Strict Android final delivery-status observation | **PASS** | `readNativeDispatchStatus`: `0/0`; `native-final-status.json`, `android-final-status.redacted.json`; two ordered `ACCEPTED`, local `NODE_REPORTED`, remote `RELAY_PERSISTED` |
| Full React Native flow, physical Android, public HTTPS | **NOT_RUN** | Outside this bounded emulator/native checkpoint |
| Core scoped privacy scan and outcome evidence | **PASS** | Core `verify-private`: `0`; `core-native-outcome.redacted.json`; Client did not read the Hub database |
| Owned Android emulator and reverse cleanup | **PASS** | Reverse removal and emulator stop: `0` each; `client-teardown.redacted.json` |
| Core-owned Hub/Node fixture teardown | **NOT_RUN** | Core retained its fixture for independent audit at Client handoff; Client was explicitly instructed to leave it intact |

Core evidence is under `/home/zyf/CICADA/.cicada-data/native-review-0d532f2/`. `native-run.json` records the actual Docker argv and start exit; `native-final.redacted.json` records native exit `0` and scoped scan exit `0`. The Client independently matched source/image/binary hashes, the three original identities and epochs, the original preview/broadcast and ordered roster. Its copied summary hashes operational identifiers. The Core-owned scan checked the exact synthetic body and three context markers in this fixture's Hub DB/WAL/SHM; it does not establish a universal plaintext-absence claim.

The final read-only Android RPC advanced the sequence by one, left no pending request, and retained the original operation, Confirm identity and sequence, consent and ordered roster. Transport outcomes and model consumption have separate evidence. One preview and one dispatch were observed in this run, with stable child-message deduplication; this is not an exactly-once guarantee under arbitrary network failures. Existing uncertain-injection boundaries remain unchanged.

The earlier `81d8f1f` failures below remain historical. Automatic model approval remained active; no bypass, replacement Thread, repeated phone approval or retry after refusal was used. Two logical Nodes shared one native container, and original Threads resumed at controlled safe points. Network M1, Group journal/discussions/regroup implementation, the separate reconciled-operation UI limitation, and further model runs remain outside this checkpoint. No product code changed, and nothing was pushed, merged or published.

Keep Core native runner source 0d532f2 separate from Hub source 25013b5.

Reconcile ten fresh Android PASS selectors, the original three-Thread native
PASS, strict final transport status, exact installed APKs, command exits and
identity hashes. Preserve the old 81d8f1f failures and this run's initial harness
errors. Native consumption and transport acceptance have separate evidence;
one observed dispatch is not a general exactly-once execution guarantee.

Client emulator/reverse cleanup passed. Core retained its Hub/Node fixture for
its independent audit and owns its final teardown; report that outcome separately.
Physical Android, public HTTPS, unattended cold wake and a fresh full React
Native screen flow were not validated. Do not start another model run, broaden
implementation, change Client files, push, merge or publish as part of review.

## Historical `81d8f1f` candidate and evidence separation

The historical candidate is clean Hub
`81d8f1f90895f41c4f5ea5c67a6281ccda9e1264`, contract `client-hub-v1.3`,
image `sha256:0c484d1c10a9fd71e6ae74ddd7fec85ae6ae8cbecf2ece6f90d393892990a04f`.
Archive SHA-256 is
`6eaa692cc9e31e0482d94ed9f26ed277dfc91fd37333949d3e2517f498ba4061`;
catalog SHA-256 is
`808f9f635effc5fa845572b976c89696ea2bb86a6a9b6f326e49d1409b570377`.
The imported snapshot is `contracts/client-hub-v1.3-81d8f1f`.

Client validation source is `10cd3dcb3bd73e6513df428ced81d95788e1cb84`.
The installed product APK remains source
`9568b2ff6d4e156b70484c10b7fd5195405004b0`, SHA-256
`f8c82d7091ffebb6add77c003c55a6f033ad657475b51b62b512bef5b0ed8700`.
The installed AndroidTest APK is SHA-256
`8c2f122e76e22f6845bbdaf0518146ed94a1f6895abdab1147d3010b4c531e09`.
The app rebuilt beside this test APK was not installed. The test-only change
corrects synthetic RFC3339Nano timestamps; production verification is unchanged.

The [first candidate run](client-monitor-v13-81d8f1f-native-validation.md)
passed 15 Kotlin public-vector tests, nine contract-checker regressions, fixed
image provenance, and ten Android integration selectors. The latter include
three actual native Endpoint manifests, external Owner signatures, explicit
phone grants with `CURRENT`, one accepted Prepare, one outbound Confirm, and a
read-only final status with two ordered `ACCEPTED` recipients. The evidence tiers
were `NODE_REPORTED` locally and `RELAY_PERSISTED` remotely.

The full native scenario in that run remains **FAIL**, native exit `1`: the
local recipient's no-tool recall retained the original context and child message
ID but omitted the expected body marker. Its preceding structured receive had
passed exact-body checks. Remote model consumption was **NOT_RUN**. Core
identified ambiguity in the recall prompt and changed two test prompt strings
without relaxing the assertions. The failed run was archived and its owned
resources were removed; cleanup is **PASS**. No Client read of the Hub database
was involved.

The [fresh recall run](client-monitor-v13-81d8f1f-recall-validation.md) uses a new
disposable Hub, Android identity and three new original native Threads. Its
separate native test source is `d76e63009192422d13e0e3b413e857a27866c750`, with
binary SHA-256
`15a436025b69c85e74b6151efdc4d0414cc082ff60cd2e0b6b643b47c64ae2e8`.
The fixed Hub image and both APKs are unchanged. Results from the first run and
all older images retain their own provenance and are not reused as runtime
results for this fresh run.

### Fresh-run outcome and command index

**Client Group authorization and explicit consent: PASS. Full native broadcast:
BLOCKED.** Automatic Codex approval review rejected both MCP attempts in one
native turn because the sealed payload and Group scope were not independently
inspectable through the supplied approval ID. The native container exited `1`
before creating a Monitor outbox or recipient children. No review bypass,
replacement approval, or further model run was attempted.

The unchanged product UI could not reopen the original operation after launch:
its status index filters out already reconciled Confirms. This is a remaining
Client UI limitation, recorded separately from the native review block. No
product change was made in this checkpoint. A new **test-only** selector in
Client commit `02cefa94bc6096f7196d1df572a22a1f64774d74` read the actual encrypted
status without submitting or recovering a write. Its AndroidTest APK SHA-256 is
`4cbc0e1ff0546b665e55136c1453334e282d19c380e26b63aa8601cd27a3f90b`.
Only that observation uses this APK; the preceding nine selectors retain test
APK `8c2f122e…`. Product APK `f8c82d…` remained installed throughout.
The scoped phone approvals in these selectors use instrumentation-driven
Android dialogs on the App activity. They do not repeat the complete React
Native consent-screen acceptance previously recorded under Set H.

The observed status was **APPROVED**, with **zero recipient outcomes**. The
single status RPC advanced the request sequence once and left no pending
request. Original operation and Confirm identifiers, Confirm sequence, consent,
recipient roster and sealed payload remained unchanged. The strict delivered
status selector was **NOT_RUN** in this fresh attempt. The earlier run's
`DISPATCH_AUTHORIZED` result must not be substituted for it.

Let `E=/gpu1-share/data/cicada-client/monitor-v13-81d8f1f-recall-20260927T065926Z/evidence`.
The linked report lists full selectors and artifacts; each command JSON records
the actual argument list and exit code.

| Check | Result | Command / exit and evidence under `E` |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed archive, clean running image and encrypted capabilities | **PASS** | Docker contract checker: `0`; image inspection: `0`; `enrollOwnerAndCheckCapabilities`: ADB/driver `0/0`; `archive-preflight.redacted.json`, `fresh-contract-check.json`, `running-hub-provenance.redacted.json`, `native-enroll-capabilities.json` |
| Nine Android setup, Group and consent selectors | **PASS** | `python3 scripts/interop/monitor-android.py "$E" test <selector> --label <label>`: each ADB/driver `0/0`, `OK (1 test)`; `native-*.json` selector matrix in the report |
| Complete native proofs, external Owner signing, three phone grants and `CURRENT` | **PASS** | Core `sign-groups` helper and external signer: `0`; `grantEndpointKeysAndReadCurrent`: `0/0`; `native-scope-comparison.redacted.json`, `owner-sign-groups.json`, `group-key-reviews.redacted.json` |
| Original native Monitor dispatch and recipient consumption | **BLOCKED** | Core exact binary `TestMCPMonitorBroadcastAndroidClientNative`: container exit `1`; `core-native-blocked.redacted.json` retains the Docker command, source/hash and approval-review outcome |
| Product UI reopening of an already reconciled Confirm | **BLOCKED** | Bounded navigation wrapper: `1`, no status RPC or new write; `readonly-ui-limitation.redacted.json` |
| Separate read-only actual-status observation | **PASS** | `./scripts/docker-build-android-test.sh`: `0`; `readOriginalBroadcastStatus`: ADB/driver `0/0`, `OK (1 test)`; `readonly-observation-test-build.json`, `native-observed-status.json`, `android-observed-status.redacted.json` |
| Strict delivered-status assertion, remote model consumption, physical Android, public HTTPS | **NOT_RUN** | No qualifying result for these gates in this fresh run |
| Scoped privacy checks and owned-environment cleanup | **PASS** | Document/mount check: `0`; reverse removal, emulator stop and marked Hub fixture stop: `0` each; `client-privacy-preflight.redacted.json`, `native-teardown.redacted.json` |

Core archived its native command, approval-review analysis and scoped Hub scan
under `/home/zyf/CICADA/.cicada-data/native-joint-recall-d76e630/`. Its scan found
no synthetic private-body marker in the three scanned Hub artifacts. This is
Core-owned, bounded evidence; the Client did not inspect the Hub database and
does not claim a universal plaintext audit. Original Thread identities are
retained as hashes; raw session records and credentials were not copied. Both
attempts' disposable Hub/Node state and emulators were removed after evidence
capture. Resident Hubs were untouched. No push, merge or publication occurred.

Android Group keys CURRENT and explicit consent passed in both runs. Preserve
the first native FAIL and the fresh native approval-review BLOCKED result.
Fresh final encrypted status is APPROVED with zero recipient outcomes;
the older run's transport evidence is not evidence of this run's dispatch.

The next native acceptance requires an auditable way for automatic approval
review to verify the phone-authorized exact body, Group and recipient scope.
Please identify the necessary trusted evidence/interface and its security
checks. Do not bypass approval review, treat opaque approval IDs as sufficient
authorization, resend the old confirmation, or relabel blocked work as PASS.
Deliver any changed protocol, runner and image with independent provenance
before another bounded native run. No further model call is authorized by this
handoff itself.

Record the Client's separate UI follow-up: a reconciled Monitor operation
cannot currently be reopened after app launch. Do not edit CICADA_CLIENT from
the core thread. Physical Android and public HTTPS remain NOT_RUN. Preserve
historical N4/N5 and v1.2.1 results under their original images and APKs.
Do not push, merge, publish or modify production state.
```

## Historical joint native Monitor attempt — `be0269e`

**FAIL** on the unchanged fixed Hub `be0269e`. The original native Session
heartbeat was rejected after legacy presence cleanup marked the Endpoint
offline while its binding remained leased. Core-owned evidence records three
real original Codex Threads, native process exit `1`, zero model retries and
zero replacement Threads. The Client did not inspect the Hub database.

The [native acceptance report](client-monitor-v13-native-acceptance.md) records
commands, exits, redacted identities and stage-specific APKs. Six Android
selectors passed: device preparation, encrypted enrollment/capabilities, two
Node confirmations, Group creation, explicit broadcast permission with the
role-only rejection probe, and independent full Endpoint manifest verification.
No external Group proof was signed, no Group grant was submitted, and no
positive Prepare or Confirm was sent. Native dispatch, recipient consumption,
final status, physical Android and public HTTPS are **NOT_RUN** for this run.

Client test commit `1172000f5ebd03a34b0b589702f1fc7d56409433` adds only a
read-only final-status selector; its build passed, but the selector was
**NOT_RUN** because native dispatch was blocked. The installed app remained
Set H SHA-256 `f8c82d7091ffebb6add77c003c55a6f033ad657475b51b62b512bef5b0ed8700`.
Later stages used test APK
`ea6bcc09d456da0fd2b5fb14f11a92ba88f55e965a9eff474af86ccac3512601`.
The rebuilt app with a different hash was not installed. Core test/helper
source `877062f30835023a26bd546972aca1e83dcffcac` is separate from the fixed
Hub image source.

The completed Set H and RPC recovery results below remain historical results
of their own runs. A core fix or later image does not retroactively pass this
failed joint attempt. A new fixed candidate and a separate native run remain
required; neither is part of this Client delivery.

Cleanup is **PASS**: owned reverse removal, emulator stop and marked Hub fixture
stop each exited `0`; see `native-teardown.redacted.json` in the report's evidence
directory. Core archived original Thread records before cleanup. They are
**NATIVE_THREAD_RECORDS_PRESERVED**, while the removed fixture is
**HUB_BINDING_NOT_RECOVERABLE_AFTER_FIXTURE_CLEANUP**. No resident Hub was targeted.
No new model run or replacement Thread was started, and nothing was pushed or
merged.

## Original Set H delivery status

**PASS** for the documented Android emulator protocol and product-interface
acceptance using synthetic authorization Endpoints. This is not native Monitor
execution or release acceptance. The disposable Hub, Node state, Owner private
keys, proxy and emulator have been removed. Only the Client repository changed;
nothing was pushed, merged, published or deployed to production.

The [fixed-image validation record](client-hub-v1.3-be0269e-validation.md) is the
complete command, exit-code, artifact and evidence matrix. Historical v1.2.1
N4/N5, native Group and two-Owner results below retain their original artifacts.
They are not evidence for the v1.3 target.

## Final acceptance summary

Let `E=/gpu1-share/data/cicada-client/monitor-v13-20260927T005634Z-be0269e/evidence`.
Its directory is `0700`; evidence files are `0600`. The table names only
restricted evidence paths. Detailed selectors and commands are in the linked
validation record and each command JSON.

| Check | Result | Command / exit and evidence under `E` |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed bundle, image and encrypted capabilities | **PASS** | `python3 scripts/check-client-contract.py`: 0; image inspection: 0; capabilities instrumentation: ADB/driver 0/0, `OK (1 test)`; `final16-runtime-provenance.json`, `final16-capabilities.json` |
| Independent Kotlin vectors and recovery guards | **PASS** | Four instrumentation suites: ADB/driver 0/0; 6 Monitor, 6 recovery-lock, 4 Endpoint and 5 wire tests; `final16-*-vectors.json`, `final16-recovery-locks.json` |
| Android build and TypeScript/JavaScript boundary | **PASS** | `./scripts/docker-build-android-test.sh`: 0; Docker TypeScript, JavaScript (13 tests) and ESLint: 0; `android-build-16-native-result-adapter.json`, `final16-{typescript,javascript,eslint}.json` |
| External Owner proof and explicit Android Group grants | **PASS** | `grantEndpointKeysAndReadCurrent`: ADB/driver 0/0, `OK (1 test)`; three reviewed phone confirmations; `final16-fresh-group-grants.json`, `phase3-fixture-preparation.redacted.json` |
| Lost Prepare and Confirm HTTP 200 responses | **PASS** | Four instrumentation selectors: ADB/driver 0/0, `OK (1 test)` each; `final16-{dropped,recovered}-{prepare,confirm}.json`; exact original ciphertext retained/recovered, no replacement operation or second Confirm |
| Changed text, foreign preview, bounded capacity and revoked permission | **PASS** | Three instrumentation selectors: ADB/driver 0/0, `OK (1 test)` each; `final16-reject-body-preview.json`, `final16-capacity.json`, `final16-reject-stale.json`; revocation rejected before a Confirm packet was persisted |
| Actual React Native consent and status interface | **PASS** | Recorded ADB navigation/input/confirmation commands: 0; UI hierarchy and Client-journal checks: 0; `final16-product-ui.redacted.json`, `final16-fresh-approved-status.private.png`; shows approval and explicitly does not claim delivery |
| Known-secret scan and isolated environment cleanup | **PASS** | Scoped scan: 0, zero matches; owned proxy/emulator/core fixture stop commands: 0; `privacy-check.redacted.json`, `final16-teardown.redacted.json` |
| New native Monitor delivery or model consumption | **NOT_RUN** | Synthetic Node/Endpoint authorization fixtures only; core-native results remain separate |
| Physical Android, dual physical Nodes, public HTTPS | **NOT_RUN** | No qualifying environment run |
| Live v1.3 Monitor `STILL_PROCESSING`, `OUTCOME_UNCERTAIN`, `RECOVERY_UNAVAILABLE` faults | **NOT_RUN** | Local uncertainty guards passed; historical v1.2.1 live fault tests are not relabeled as v1.3 Monitor acceptance |

No core API blocker remains for the tested protocol/UI slice. The report retains
earlier failures: an excessive grant/preview lifetime constraint, missing
current authorization preflight, Fabric parent mounting, and native-to-UI DTO
mismatch. It also distinguishes expired fixture grants from actual revocation
tests. Those failures were not relabeled as passing runs.

## Implementation and security boundary

Dedicated Kotlin methods independently verify the complete Endpoint attestation,
Owner grant, exact consent roster and envelope v2. Before the first Confirm is
sealed, the session recovers the reviewed Prepare and rereads current topology
and the source Group grant through encrypted RPC. It validates current identity,
binding, key and signed revisions, then seals with the reserved Confirm request
sequence. Topology CAS versions are not substituted for signed revisions.

The exact inner envelope and outer RPC packet are persisted before sending.
Recovery uses the original packet. The interface now converts the verified
native RPC result into its explicit display model, and distinguishes a refused
preflight from a persisted Confirm. Pending or uncertain writes stay blocked;
read-only reconciliation remains available. No automatic replacement operation
or silent approval is introduced.

The UI preserves local speech transcription and the existing management screens.
`external_thread_links=false` continues to prevent ordinary cross-user messaging.
This acceptance does not establish physical Keystore isolation, public HTTPS,
blind-Hub peer messaging or runtime/model consumption. Owner private keys and
Node bearer credentials stayed outside Android, Git and the APK. The scoped
secret scan is not a universal audit of every possible credential representation.

## Follow-up: Monitor Prepare RPC recovery faults — 2026-09-27

**PASS** for the three bounded recovery-layer scenarios on the same frozen
Hub `be0269e` image. This is a separate run with fresh disposable Hubs and
Android device identities; it does not rewrite Set H or demonstrate Monitor
business execution. The [recovery fault report](client-monitor-v13-recovery-faults.md)
records the commands, exits, artifact identities, earlier harness failures and
cleanup evidence.

| `OUTCOME_UNCERTAIN` | **PASS** — signed encrypted response after `FAULT_READY` and same-container/same-state restart; reserved response sequence consumed once; original packet retained for reconciliation |
| `RECOVERY_UNAVAILABLE` | **PASS** — HTTP 409; original pending request retained and fenced |
| Native delivery, Confirm fault scenarios, physical Android, public HTTPS | **NOT_RUN** in this follow-up |

Each scenario's device preparation, encrypted enrollment/capabilities, capture
and recovery selector returned ADB/driver exit `0/0` and `OK (1 test)`:
12 instrumentation tests in total. Three distinct Hub identity hashes and
Android device key hashes were verified. The fixed core fixture inserts only
a recovery ledger entry; it does not dispatch `monitor.broadcast_prepare`.
No Monitor-level recovery lookup or Confirm was called.

Docker reassigned the disposable Hub's published port after restart. The
runner verified the same container, image, state mount and Hub identity, then
retargeted only its proxy upstream while preserving the Android origin. The
original proxy recorded one `FAULT_READY`; the replacement proxy recorded no
second fault injection. Generic encrypted `status.snapshot` reconciliation
did not clear the unresolved `PREPARE_UNCERTAIN` metadata or enable a new
Prepare. These checks do not certify recovery after a real Monitor business
handler has partially executed.

See `acceptance-summary.redacted.json`, `final-teardown.redacted.json` and each
scenario's `recovery-result.json`. All owned fixtures, synthetic keys, proxies,
Android sessions and the emulator were removed. No production code, core
checkout, resident Hub or frozen artifact was changed; nothing was pushed or
merged.

The APKs are candidate debug/test artifacts, not signed release packages. Protocol package, manifest, and image-label checks passed. The imported files are under [`contracts/client-hub-v1.2.1-967dbd`](../contracts/client-hub-v1.2.1-967dbd/manifest.json).

## Two-Owner authorization acceptance — 2026-09-26

The separate two-Owner slice is **PASS** on implementation commit
`680fac2bf12c431ac02804e5db168669cf12941f`. It uses the same clean fixed Hub
commit, archive, catalog and complete image ID above. It adds only disposable
fixture and Android instrumentation code. The existing UI, local STT and
production cryptographic checks were preserved. No Monitor operations or
new contract version were introduced.

The final fresh-run evidence root is
`/gpu1-share/data/cicada-client/two-owner-20260926T024036Z-cto-9uslracc/evidence`
(`E2` below). Its debug APK SHA-256 is
`cfe345272f2399cbed7cd76f47e25e3e6fc09ed94daadb1d6e1a6ba9106caff1`;
its AndroidTest APK SHA-256 is
`342845155edf0333e3b81aa736d25945e8d83554a61c26fc1bf438c314d26ae0`.
The app artifact is unchanged from the final one-Owner Group run; this
authorization result comes from new execution with a different test APK.

For the commands below, `F=/tmp/cto.9uslracc` was the disposable fixture,
now removed, and `A=python3 scripts/interop/two-owner-android.py`.
The [complete authorization report](client-two-owner-v1.2.1-967dbd-validation.md)
contains exact commands, failures from the initial development attempt,
image/helper provenance and evidence limits.

| Check | Result | Command and exit | Evidence under `E2` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Clean fixed target and package verification | **PASS** | `python3 scripts/interop/two-owner-fixture.py prepare`: 0; nested contract verifier: 0 | `fixed-target.json`, `verify-contract.log`, `runtime-provenance.json`, `fixture-commands.jsonl` |
| Independent Android device keys A, A-admin and B | **PASS** | `$A "$F" test prepareTwoOwnerDeviceKeys`: runner 0, ADB 0, `OK (1 test)` | `prepareTwoOwnerDeviceKeys.json` |
| Owner-bound encrypted capabilities, Node confirmations and separate Groups | **PASS** | `$A "$F" test enrollConfirmAndCreateOwnerGroups`: runner 0, ADB 0, `OK (1 test)`; four reviewed taps: 0 | `enrollConfirmAndCreateOwnerGroups.json`, `reviewed-taps.json` |
| Live manifests, complete Android proof verification and external Owner signatures | **PASS** | `$A "$F" test exportOwnerGroupManifests`: runner 0, ADB 0, `OK (1 test)`; `sign-groups "$F"` through fixture driver: 0 | `exportOwnerGroupManifests.json`, `fixture-commands.jsonl` |
| Both own grants `CURRENT`; six cross-Owner requests denied; tampered proof rejected at Hub | **PASS** | `$A "$F" test twoOwnerOwnershipAndRevocationMatrix`: runner 0, ADB 0, `OK (1 test)`; two reviewed grant taps: 0 | `twoOwnerOwnershipAndRevocationMatrix.json`, `summary.redacted.json`, `reviewed-taps.json` |
| Local pending/identity isolation, authoritative grant records unchanged, revoke A while B remains usable | **PASS** | Same matrix command: 0; includes fresh A request and exact old packet `/rpc` and `/recover` HTTP 403 | `summary.redacted.json`, matrix private log |
| Known-secret checks and cleanup | **PASS** | Local evidence scan: 0; `python3 scripts/interop/two-owner-fixture.py stop "$F"`: 0 | `privacy-check.redacted.json`, `teardown.json` |
| New native Codex/Thread run; physical Android; public HTTPS | **NOT_RUN** | No commands for these gates in this slice | Earlier native evidence remains separately attributed |

No required item in this two-Owner slice remains **BLOCKED**. The Hub negative
cases used each other Owner's real existing Group, Endpoint and valid Owner
proof. All six requests returned HTTP 200 with a verified encrypted
`permission denied` business result. The separate corrupted-signature request
reached the Hub verifier and returned a signature rejection. These are distinct
from the product's local preflight errors and the HTTP 403 responses after
revocation. The authenticated negative requests legitimately advance Hub
request/response counters; unchanged state refers to target grants and isolated
Client journals, not an unchanged Hub request ledger.

These Endpoints are explicitly **synthetic authorization fixtures**, not native
sessions. The three Android contexts have independent PQ identities and journals
but share one emulator app UID and Keystore wrapping alias. The wrong-device
response-open assertion rejects a route/recipient mismatch; it is not a separate
OS key-isolation or KEM-decapsulation experiment. Owner/Endpoint private keys and
Node bearers stayed outside Android. Both runs' disposable Hub/Node/emulator
state and credentials were removed. Nothing was pushed, merged or deployed.

## Earlier evidence on this fixed target

- An independent Android session completed encrypted `session.capabilities` against the fixed image.
- Exact enrollment Grant replay after a lost HTTP 201 and exact encrypted RPC recovery after a lost HTTP 200 passed. The Android tests each returned `OK (1 test)` and ADB exit 0; the proxy evidence records the upstream response before dropping the downstream response.
- All three Android recovery fault tests passed with a new disposable Hub under `/tmp`. Each scenario script exited 0 and each final Android test returned `OK (1 test)` with ADB exit 0. For the uncertain outcome, the test waited for `FAULT_READY`, restarted only the disposable Hub, then recovered the signed encrypted notice. The details and Git-external evidence paths are in the validation report.
- Candidate APK `70423555e96381722d1bdc46633d32c0fca6dc32edae4dfb45865abc1059d197` passed `EndpointAttestationVectorTest` (`OK (4 tests)`, ADB exit 0), covering the full Endpoint proof, synthetic manifest digests, and owner proof. Subsequent review found that this candidate rejects valid RFC3339Nano timestamps with four fractional digits.
- The fix in commit `af3ad451e29d0c43142b3fc792272bbd6df75c84` passed `./scripts/docker-build-android-test.sh` (exit 0) and `EndpointAttestationVectorTest` on `emulator-5554` (`OK (4 tests)`, ADB exit 0), producing corrected APKs `2762a2…` and `711e00…` above.
- Candidate APK/test pair `7042…`/`5075…` passed `ClientWirePublicVectorTest` (`OK (5 tests)`) and `ClientHubRecoveryLockTest` (`OK (3 tests)`), each ADB exit 0 on `emulator-5554`.
- On the `7042…` APK, E2E setup `enrollAndRead` passed against the Hub on port 8794 (`OK (1 test)`, ADB exit 0), verifying encrypted capabilities and status. A fresh `cicada machine agent --once` reached the expected pending-device-code state before confirmation; Android `confirmDisposableNodeForQueuedGoal` verified the previewed Node ID and encrypted `nodes.confirm` (`OK (1 test)`, ADB exit 0). Its device code stayed in an external `0600` file.
- The completed native E2E accepted one real Codex approval on the original Thread and Worker attempt 1. The Worker and Goal completed, Intent resolved, and `goal.result` was present and byte-matched the 30-byte Node result. The exact runner commands, exits, redacted IDs and digests are in the validation report. This run used `7042…`, so it does not exercise the corrected Group timestamp verifier in `2762…`.
- E2E cleanup removed the proxy, temporary Node/Codex state, wrapper, device code, and test marker; the one-time Codex container used `--rm`. The provider environment was mounted read-only only into that isolated Codex container, and no bearer or secret entered the Node process, APK, repository, or logs. The disposable Hub was stopped and removed; other Hub containers were left untouched. Sanitized evidence remains outside Git with restricted permissions.
- The later disposable Group fixture supplied a real native Codex Endpoint. Android validated the full manifest, imported an externally signed `signed_proof`, required an explicit on-device confirmation, and read encrypted `group.key_status=CURRENT` on final implementation commit `b676668e33c876c0d2c89bc3495fbd0d1e128c82`. The Owner private key stayed outside the APK. Exact APK hashes, commands and limits are in the [Group key acceptance report](client-group-key-v1.2.1-disposable-validation.md).
- The Android builds passed; build logs and exact commands/exits are in the validation report. The independent loss/recovery tests used the earlier candidate artifacts listed above. The candidate with the timestamp issue is not called final for Group-key validation.

## Final Group acceptance: result and evidence index

All rows below use the fixed Hub image in the baseline table and the final Group APK pair above. Let `E=/gpu1-share/data/cicada-client/group-key-v121-967dbd/evidence`; this directory is `0700`, its evidence files are `0600`, and its raw IDs, signed public proofs and logs are outside Git. Arguments containing IDs, one-time codes or proofs are omitted from the command column. The [full Group report](client-group-key-v1.2.1-disposable-validation.md) records the test order, hashed Endpoint/Session/Group/Node/binding labels, command exits and limits. It does not turn earlier `7042…` or `2762…` results into final-APK evidence.

| Check | Result | Command and exit code | Evidence under `$E` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Archive, clean source, exact image and encrypted capabilities | **PASS** | `python3 ../CICADA/scripts/client-contract.py verify <fixed archive>`: 0; `docker image inspect <full image ID>`: 0; `python3 "$E/run-android-test.py" "$E/external-capabilities.spec.json"`: 0, JUnit `OK (1 test)` | `fixed-target-provenance.json`, `external-capabilities.log` |
| Android device preparation, owner-signed enrollment and Node/Group setup | **PASS**, with the failed combined harness attempt below | `python3 "$E/run-android-test.py" "$E/prepare-device.spec.json"`: 0; `python3 "$E/run-android-test.py" "$E/reconcile-group.spec.json"`: 0, JUnit `OK (1 test)`; reviewed on-screen taps: 0 | `prepare-device.log`, `device-signer.private.log`, `external-capabilities.log`, `reconcile-group.log`, `confirm-node-after.private.log` |
| Real native Codex Join, separate candidate publication, complete Android manifest verification and external Owner signing | **PASS** | `python3 "$E/rapid-prepare-grant.py" finalui`: 0; embedded manifest instrumentation: 0, JUnit `OK (1 test)` | `codex-finalui.private.jsonl`, `native-finalui.private.json`, `manifest-finalui.log`, `group-signer-finalui.private.log` |
| Phone confirmation, encrypted `group.key_grant`, separate encrypted `group.key_status=CURRENT` | **PASS** | `python3 "$E/run-android-test.py" "$E/grant-finalui.spec.json"`: 0, JUnit `OK (1 test)`; reviewed on-screen tap: 0 | `grant-finalui.log`, `grant-finalui-dialog.private.png`, `grant-finalui.private.json` |
| Mutated Owner signature and wrong Owner key selection; nonexistent Group/Endpoint scope | **PASS**, limited to Client-side rejection and encrypted Hub business rejections | `python3 "$E/run-android-test.py" "$E/reject-tampered-proof-finalui.spec.json"`: 0; `python3 "$E/run-android-test.py" "$E/reject-wrong-scope.spec.json"`: 0; each JUnit `OK (1 test)` | `reject-tampered-proof-finalui.log`, `reject-wrong-scope.log` |
| Accepted grant after native lease expiry, then proof expiry | **PASS**: `STALE`, then `PROOF_EXPIRED` | `python3 "$E/run-android-test.py" "$E/status-stale-finalui.spec.json"`: 0; `python3 "$E/run-android-test.py" "$E/status-proof-expired-finalui.spec.json"`: 0; each JUnit `OK (1 test)` | `status-stale-finalui.log`, `status-proof-expired-finalui.log` |
| Early manager-role assertion and combined Node preview/Group runner | **FAIL** as harness attempts, not final protocol results | `python3 "$E/run-android-test.py" "$E/enroll-and-capabilities.spec.json"`: runner 1, ADB 0, JUnit `FAILURES!!!`; `python3 "$E/run-android-test.py" "$E/confirm-node-create-group.spec.json"`: runner 1, ADB 0, JUnit `FAILURES!!!` | `enroll-and-capabilities.log`, `confirm-node-create-group.log`; the code-bearing second spec was deleted at teardown; corrected external-role and Group runs above |
| Independent Hub submission of a tampered grant; second real Owner cross-owner authorization | **NOT_RUN** | No qualifying command; the Client fenced the tampered proof and the fixture enrolled only one Owner | No claim of server-side tamper or two-Owner rejection |
| Physical Android hardware; public HTTPS | **NOT_RUN** | No command run | Emulator loopback evidence does not establish either environment |

No item remains **BLOCKED** for the one-Owner positive path. The initial long Node state path blocked the Unix Join socket, but a short real private `/tmp` state directory enabled the final PASS; the fixture improvement request is below. The disposable Hub/Node, short state directory, ADB reverse mapping and emulator app data were removed with exit 0. The synthetic Node code briefly appeared in a transient process-inspection output; it expired and its private spec was deleted. The full report records that privacy finding and the evidence metadata class-name correction.

## Contract correction and outstanding validation

The previous `41beaf0` v1.2 report recorded a mismatch between the prose and Go implementation for `EndpointKeyAttestation` v1: the implementation signs compact JSON with a final `"signature":null` field. The fixed v1.2.1 wire contract documents those exact bytes and the bundle contains a public synthetic vector. This closes the published contract ambiguity. Candidate `70423555…` failed a valid four-digit RFC3339Nano fraction check; commit `af3ad451e29d0c43142b3fc792272bbd6df75c84` fixes it. The later disposable Group run on the same fixed image independently established the live positive path with a different final APK pair; the earlier Node/Codex and vector APKs are not counted as its proof.

The real Node/Codex approval run is **PASS** for this fixed image, as described above. The E2E topology snapshot/Endpoint group-membership probe, physical Android hardware, and public HTTPS are **NOT_RUN**. The earlier `41beaf0` result remains historical and is not the evidence used for this pass.

The first attempt to run the recovery fixture from a `/gpu1` working directory failed with HTTP 502 because the fixture requires a real `/tmp` root. The corrected disposable `/tmp` run passed. Both results are recorded as such; the failed attempt is not counted as a protocol failure or a PASS.

## Security and environment boundary

All current Hub tests used an isolated disposable state. No Android Client stores Hub or Node bearer credentials or reads the Hub database. Sensitive test material and raw logs stay outside Git under `/gpu1-share/data/cicada-client/hub-v1.2.1-967dbd/`; the report names only the required evidence paths. The Client uses independently pinned Hub identity, an owner-signed device Grant, encrypted `session.capabilities`, and encrypted `/v2/client/rpc`. It does not call legacy `/v1` bearer APIs.

This integration validates Client-to-Control management encryption. It does not prove ordinary peer messages are unreadable to the Hub. The fixed contract keeps `status_events=false` and `external_thread_links=false`; cross-user links remain proposals, not routable Threads. No real-device key boundary or public HTTPS conclusion follows from emulator results.

## Next actions

1. Preserve the fixed-image Group acceptance and original Node/Codex approval traces as separate evidence sets. The Group result uses APK `cfe34527…` and native Codex candidate publishing; the earlier Goal approval result uses APK `70423555…` and exercises a different path.
2. Use the separate two-Owner report above for cross-Owner authorization and Hub-side signature rejection. That gap is now closed for the fixed image with synthetic Endpoints; it does not replace native Thread evidence.
3. Run physical-device key/Keystore and public HTTPS tests before making deployment claims. Both remain **NOT_RUN**.

## Core fixture feedback

The core-side `client-group-key-fixture.sh` and its recipe enabled the positive acceptance without new production routes. One operational issue arose: its long `/tmp/cicada-client-group-key.*` directory plus long synthetic Node ID exceeded the Unix-domain Join socket path limit. The Node Agent exited before Join. A short symlink allowed the socket but was correctly rejected by Node-local Endpoint key storage, which requires a real directory. The Client run copied only this disposable Node state into a private short real `/tmp` directory and then completed the test; both state locations were removed during teardown. Please make the fixture allocate a sufficiently short **real** Node state path and document the same-path MCP settings. This is fixture ergonomics, not evidence of a fixed-image protocol change.

The synthetic Owner's encrypted `session.capabilities` role was `external`, with Group and topology operations in its allowlist. The Client's legacy manager-role enrollment assertion failed after successful enrollment; a separate external-role encrypted capabilities test passed. The core fixture documentation should state that role explicitly so a future runner does not mistake the expected role for a Hub fault.

The one-Owner disposable fixture succeeded: Android encrypted manifest,
independent full Endpoint verification, external Owner signing, explicit phone
confirmation, encrypted grant and status CURRENT. The same grant became STALE
after the native binding lease expired and PROOF_EXPIRED after the proof expired;
the Android Client rejected a mutated Owner signature before submission.
The later two-Owner authorization run also passed with synthetic Endpoints:
both own grants CURRENT; A-to-B and B-to-A manifest/status/grant denied inside
authenticated encrypted responses; a corrupted public signature rejected by
the Hub; revoked A new requests and original-packet RPC/recover rejected with
HTTP 403, while B remained usable. It does not repeat native Thread acceptance.

Read the reports and working tree read-only. Review the fixed identities,
exact APK attribution, command exits, redacted summaries and teardown records.
The first development attempt's compile and canonical-input failures are
retained separately from the successful final fresh run. No core interface
gap remains for this authorization slice; do not request another replacement
fixture or expand Client to unshipped Monitor operations. Preserve the fixed
image and contract; a new Hub build needs a clean commit and complete
archive/catalog/image identity before new acceptance.

Do not put Owner private keys or Node bearers in Android, Git or logs, and do
not inspect or mutate a live Hub database. Physical Android and public HTTPS
remain NOT_RUN until independently tested.
```
